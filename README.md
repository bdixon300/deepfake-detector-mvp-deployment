# deepfake-detector-deployment-backend
MVP demo for Deepfake detection model. Run frontend with "npm start" from the react app directory. 
Run backend using "flask run" in the top directory. The react app will take any YouTube video input, no other URL will work.
This demo was designed for collecting user feedback so it could be improved for production.
